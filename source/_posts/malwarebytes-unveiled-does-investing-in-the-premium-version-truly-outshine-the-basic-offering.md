## MalwareBytes Unveiled: Does Investing in the Premium Version Truly Outshine the Basic Offering?

Using a free version is not a problem but one always wants to know if paying for. Question generally pops up while thinking of upgrading a freeware program. In this article, we will understand the difference between Malwarebytes Free and Premium. 

Here are three features you get by paying for Malwarebytes Premium 1\. Real-Time Protection 2\. Scheduled Scan 3\. Anti-Exploits and Anti-Ransomware

In short, Real-Time protection is the major difference between Malwarebytes Free and Premium. Free version provides on demand scanning while Premium will provide continuous protection from threats. When you download Malwarebytes for the first time, it has all premium features for 14 days. After the trial period, it becomes merely an on-demand scanner or post-infection cleanup tool that you run whenever you choose.

## Is Malwarebytes Premium worth Paying for?

Established in 2018, Malwarebytes is one of the trusted brands in Security solution. There are hardcore fans who swear by its name and it has definitely earned the glory. When Malwarebytes launched the paid version or Premium, it was one time payment or dubbed as Lifetime license.

However, from 2014, Malwarebytes changed its model to annual subscription meaning you will have to pay yearly. Change was obvious because company has to have strong financial backing for a better product. This change disappointed some early users while few agitated calling it betrayal.[![malwarebytes usage level](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/malwarebytes-usage-level.png)](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/malwarebytes-usage-level.png)Still, users who got lifetime licenses were able to use it without paying any additional charges. However, once again, there was a change recently which [restricted annual license to only one device](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malwarebytes-is-now-enforcing-lifetime-licenses-to-one-pc/). As per the license terms, it was always restricted to one device but company didn’t enforce it. So, lifetime customers kept on using on multiple computers thinking it is okay to do so.

## What should you do?

If you are okay with paying $39.99 USD per year for protecting one device, I would suggest buying Malwarebytes Premium. However, if you belong to another camp who think that’s an enormous amount or doesn’t justify, you can opt for MalwareFox. MalwareFox Premium can protect 3 devices or all computers of your household members for less than their single device plan. This actually hurts when your second device is Android based smartphone or tablet. Malwarebytes has single plan for all platforms and doesn’t differentiate between Android and Windows.

When other security vendors including MalwareFox offer Android security protection for less than $10 USD. If you are not sure, you can gain understanding by reading [Why Choose MalwareFox?](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) **Does cheap means compromise with level of protection?** Not at all. You can always get a free trial before you come to any conclusion.

## 4 thoughts on “Malwarebytes Free vs Premium”

1. Guess I was too late to renew so just purchased a one year subscription to Premium. Cannot bring it up. Still get the notice to update my payment. Please advise.

3. There are several reasons why someone might use a free VPN. And the most obvious one is to save money. Why pay for something when you can get it for free?  
[Reply](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)  
   * Providing VPN service needs special infrastructure and that requires a good amount of investment. So, free VPNs are not actually ‘free’. When you use the free VPN services, you are actually providing your personal data to them. So by using the free VPN service, you might save money, but it might still cost you a lot in other ways.
