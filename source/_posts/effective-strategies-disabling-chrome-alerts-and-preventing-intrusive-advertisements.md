##  1- Stop Notifications Request in Google Chrome

When you open a new site in your Chrome browser, the website asks your permission to show notifications. You can either select Allow or Block. This request appears beside the address field where the lock icon appears. You can close this request by pressing the cross button but next time you open that website, it will again appear. You will know in this section how to stop this request permanently from all websites. No website could ask you to show notifications.

I tested this extension on five different websites with different overlay types:

Out of all the sites, Poper Blocker was able to block the pop-ups on about four of them.

There isn’t a perfect solution to get rid of all the overlays and pop-ups. However, Poper Blocker would certainly help you a lot to prevent most of them and provide you a smooth browsing experience.
