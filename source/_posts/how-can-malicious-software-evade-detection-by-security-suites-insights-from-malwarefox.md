### Encryption

One common method is to encrypt the malicious code. This makes it difficult for antivirus programs to scan and detect the malware. In some cases, the malware is only detected after it has already executed its payload.

### Fileless Malware

Another method that malware uses to avoid detection is known as file-less malware. This type of malware does not rely on traditional files to execute its code. Instead, it uses legitimate programs that are already installed on the victim’s computer. This makes it very difficult for antivirus programs to detect and remove the malware.

### Code Mutation

Another common method used to avoid detection is code mutation. This is where the malware mutates or changes its code in order to evade detection. This makes it very difficult for antivirus programs to detect and remove the malware.

### Obfuscation

Obfuscation is a technique used to make code difficult to understand. It’s often used to make malware more difficult to detect and analyze. Hackers will use obfuscation to make it more difficult for antivirus software to detect their malware.

### Signature Evasion

Signature evasion is a technique used to make malware more difficult to detect. Hackers will use this technique to make their malware look like something else. This makes it almost impossible for antimalware applications to detect the malware.

### Masking the Code on a Website

Masking the code on a website is another common method used to avoid detection. In this technique, hackers will insert malicious code into a website that appears to be benign. When someone visits the website, the code is executed and the malware is installed on their computer.

### Hiding Malware in Image Files

Hiding malware in image files is one of the popular methods used by cybercriminals to avoid detection from antivirus. In this technique, hackers will encode malicious code into an image file. When the image is opened, the code is executed and the malware is installed on the victim’s computer.

### Stealth Techniques

There are a variety of stealth techniques that can be used to make malware more difficult to detect. These techniques include hiding files, processes, and registry entries. Hackers will use these techniques to make it more difficult for antivirus programs to find and remove the malware.

## How to Stay Safe From Malware?

Given the fact that malware can evade detection from antivirus software, it’s important to take steps to protect your computer from these threats. Below are some tips that you can use to stay safe from malware:

### Update Your Antivirus Software

One of the most important things you can do is to keep your antivirus software up-to-date. Cybercriminals are constantly developing new ways to avoid detection. By keeping your antivirus software up-to-date, you will make sure that it can detect and remove the latest threats.

### Use a Reputable Antivirus Software

It’s important to use reputable antivirus software. Some antivirus programs are better at detecting and removing malware than others. Do some research to find an antivirus program that is right for you.

### Scan Your Computer Regularly

You should scan your computer regularly for malware. This will help to ensure that any malware that is on your computer is detected and removed.

### Keep Your Operating System Up-To-Date

It’s important to keep your operating system up-to-date. Cybercriminals often target vulnerabilities in outdated operating systems. By keeping your operating system up-to-date, you will make it more difficult for them to target your computer.

### Use a Firewall

A firewall can help to protect your computer from malware. A firewall will block incoming connections from untrusted sources. This will make it more difficult for malware to infect your computer.

### Use Caution When Opening Email Attachments

One of the most common ways that malware is spread is through email attachments. Be careful when opening email attachments, even if they appear to be from a trusted source. If you’re not sure about an attachment, don’t open it.

### Be Careful When Downloading Files

When you download files from the Internet, be careful. Don’t download files from untrusted sources. If you’re not sure about a file, don’t download it.
