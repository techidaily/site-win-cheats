## What is Google Security Warning Virus?

The Google Security Warning Virus is a scam that aims to trick users to compromise their systems meanwhile the cyber criminal tries to install the malware in them. This fake security warning popping on your system warns you against the “Zeus” virus with which your system has been infected and tricks users into believing that their private information has been compromised.

Further, the users are suggested to contact a phone number or a [fake Windows Help Desk](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), which is set up by cybercriminals. As the user falls for this trap and seeks help from the help desk or the contact number, hackers lead them through a process that would ultimately compromise their system for real.

This is very much similar to [Windows Security alert](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or [Apple security alert scam](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

So, if you are also experiencing similar Google security warnings on your system, you must not fall for this trap rather follow the necessary steps ahead to remove this virus from your system.

## How did I get Infected?

Cyber criminals seek to find the simplest way to spread them over a vast audience. The best way to do this is to hide this malware in the “advanced/custom” settings of a software installation process. Usually, when you click on any random advertisement or install software, you often skip checking the advanced settings option for them. 

This is how this virus which was by default bundled to be installed on the system along with the software gets a passage in your system. The virus then starts to compromise your system slowly and steadily. Thus, rushing through a software installation process or skipping the advanced settings options can be the main reason behind your system getting infected by this virus.

## How to Remove the Google Security Warning Virus?

Getting infected by the Google Security Warning Virus might lead you to an unwanted situation after your private and sensitive data has been compromised. You must consider installing a potential antivirus software like [Total AV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) to prevent your system against such viruses. 

Apart from this, there are certainly other ways that you must adopt to remove the Google Security Warning Virus from your system.

### **Remove Unwanted/Malicious Software From Your System**

The most common way through which the Google Security Warning virus can frequently pop up on your system is by malicious or deceptive software already installed in the system. Thus, you must uninstall such software to get rid of the virus ultimately. Here is how you can do it.

* In your search bar type “Control Panel”.

* Open your control panel and under the “Programs” heading click on the “Uninstall a program” option.

* Your system will display all the software installed on it.

* Look out for all the deceptive software that you might not have installed purposely.
* Click on the software and choose the “Uninstall” option available at the top of your screen.

Once such deceptive programs are removed from your system, the Google Security Warning Virus should stop popping up.

### **Reset Your Browser Settings**

The Google Security Warning virus is notification-based. Therefore, you might be continuously experiencing it because of certain websites for whom you would have allowed the notifications to be displayed. Resetting your browser settings can refresh the entire browser and can remove the virus. 

Here is how you can reset your browser settings. We have considered the “Google Chrome” browser, although the steps to reset the browser are similar for almost every browser.

* Open your browser and click on the three dots options available at the top right corner.
* Go to the “Settings” option.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7.png)

* On the left sidebar, choose the “Reset Settings” option.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-6.png)

* Next, click on “Reset settings to their original default option” and further choose the “Reset Settings” option.

### **Download an Antivirus Program**

Rather than manually carrying out the scanning operation on your system, resetting browser settings, and other similar tasks to remove an unwanted virus, installing an antivirus program can be a great choice to consider.

Installing an [anti-malware program](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) will automatically keep a check on your system and remove any viruses, malware, or a similar threat to the system. Moreover, reliable antivirus software will also help you regularly scan your system for any malicious attack and help your system recover from it within no time.

Thus, installing an antivirus program can be a smart choice to prevent your system from such fake warnings like the Google Security Warning.
